Challenge Objective: 
Your organization has begun an effort to automate the entry of invoice details into the Integrated Invoicing Solutions accounting application. Download the provided zip file of invoices for processing. As you process each invoice, enter the invoice details into the Integrated Invoicing Solutions web app - adding all line items as needed. Once invoice details have been added, upload the matching invoice image, and submit the invoice for final approval. Submit all 7 invoices to complete the challenge.


Rules:
You're welcome to process the invoices before launching the challenge page...this challenge is not about trying to test the processing power of everyone's machines (should you choose to use IQ Bot Local processing). However, you will need to use the "Choose File" upload function of the page to select the invoice image matching the data entered for each invoice. No trying to fake this with JavaSscript, you must use the file upload capability.
